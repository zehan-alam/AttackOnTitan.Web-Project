                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Mikasa Ackerman (ミカサ・アッカーマン Mikasa Akkāman?) is the adoptive sister of Eren Yeager and one of the two deuteragonists of
                        the series, along with Armin Arlert.
                        
                        After her biological parents were murdered by human traffickers, Mikasa was rescued by Eren Yeager and lived with him
                        and his parents, Grisha and Carla, before the fall of Wall Maria. She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that
                        stayed on Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political power in Hizuru.[13]
                        
                        Though she desires only to live a peaceful life, Mikasa entered into the military—where she is considered the best
                        soldier among the 104th Training Corps. She later enlists in the Survey Corps to follow and protect Eren, becoming one
                        of its greatest assets. She is currently serving as an officer (上官 Jōkan?) in the Corps.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <label>Appearence</label>
                    <p>
                        Mikasa is a fairly tall, physically fit, and well-toned woman with muscles lined throughout her arms, legs, and abs. She
                        is of partial Asian heritage, with pale skin, gray eyes, and shaggy black hair that was long until she cut it to
                        chin-length. By the year 854, her hair is shorter and cut up to back of her neck, but with noticeably longer bangs.
                        There is a small scar below her right eye delivered by Eren's Titan during the Battle of Trost District. Jean considers
                        Mikasa to be beautiful.[14]
                        
                        Mikasa often wears the original Survey Corps uniform whose equipment is horizontally at her hips, with a white blouse
                        underneath and a black scarf which she almost always has.[15] She also wears a green cape with the wings of freedom on
                        the back during some missions.
                        
                        When off duty, Mikasa's casual attire consists of a simple knee-length white dress, a light cardigan, brown boots, and
                        her signature black scarf.
                        
                        While in Marley, Mikasa wears a black Survey Corps uniform which features a breastplate with the Survey Corps symbol,
                        many belts to accommodate all the different gear, support rods around her chest for the gas canister, and tall black
                        boots. It also has guns, thunder spears, an additional gas tank, and canisters running vertically down her legs.
                    </p>

                    <label>History</label>
                    <p>
                        Mikasa was born to an Asian mother, and her father was a member of the Ackerman clan. She lived peacefully with her
                        parents in the farmlands of Wall Maria, helping them since a young age. Mikasa underwent a painful scarring ritual from
                        her mother, who cut into her skin the mark of their family.
                        
                        Eren gives Mikasa his scarf
                        Eren gave Mikasa his scarf
                        
                        Being the last of their race made her mother and Mikasa high value targets to robbers. When she was only 9 years old, a
                        group of traffickers killed her parents and attempted to kidnap her for the purpose of selling her in the human-trading
                        market of the Capital's Underground.[28] Frightened and shocked, Mikasa was rescued by Eren Yeager, the son of her
                        family's doctor. He tricked and killed two of the kidnappers, but he was overwhelmed by the third trafficker and on the
                        verge of being strangled. Eren desperately urged Mikasa to fight to win, who came to realize that the world can be
                        callous and merciless before dispatching the robber from behind, who was trying to kill him.
                        
                        When Grisha Yeager arrived with members of the Military Police Brigade, Mikasa was given the scarf by Eren and accepted
                        into his family. This event awakened the fighting instincts and perfect self-control that runs in the Ackerman clan.
                        Mikasa then went to live with Eren's family until the Fall of Wall Maria.

                        Levi Ackerman (リヴァイ・アッカーマン Rivai Akkāman?), often formally referred to as Captain Levi (リヴァイ兵長 Rivai Heichō?), is
                        the
                        squad captain (兵士長 Heishichō?, lit. "leader of the soldiers") of the Special Operations Squad within the Survey
                        Corps,
                        and is widely known as humanity's strongest soldier.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <label>Appearence</label>
                    <p>
                        Levi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut, as well as narrow, intimidating dull gray eyes with dark
                        circles under them and a deceptively youthful face. He is quite short, but his physique is well-developed in
                        musculature
                        from extensive vertical maneuvering equipment usage. He is usually either frowning or expressionless; that, plus his
                        extremely calm demeanor, often makes it difficult for others to guess what he is thinking.
                    
                        He is most often seen in his Survey Corps uniform, with a light gray button up shirt underneath along with his
                        trademark
                        white ascot. When embarking on expeditions outside the Walls, he also wears the Survey Corps' green hooded cloak.
                        Once,
                        when forced to take leave from his duties due to injury, Levi was seen in a black suit, plain white shirt, ascot,
                        and
                        dress shoes.[citation needed] However, since the beginning of the coup d'état, he has left the ascot off. For most
                        of
                        the time during which the Survey Corps were on the run from the military and monarchy, he simply wore his vertical
                        maneuvering equipment harness over casual clothes.[citation needed]
                    
                        After a close encounter explosion from a Thunder Spear set off by Zeke Yeager, Levi now has several scars across his
                        face and is missing both his index and middle finger on his right hand.

                    <label>History</label>
                    <p>Levi is the son of Kuchel Ackerman, a prostitute who worked in the Underground and was made pregnant by one of her
                        clients. One day, Kenny Ackerman, Kuchel's older brother, came to the city to see her only to find that she was
                        dead.[24] There, he found a young and squalid Levi sitting in front of his mother's bed.
                    
                        In a rare showing of compassion, Kenny decided to take care of him. He raised Levi as well as he could: teaching him
                        knife skills, how to get along with people, and violent behavior. Levi also learned to use his own inner power that
                        he
                        possessed as a member of the Ackerman clan.
                    
                        Time passed and eventually, Kenny taught Levi everything he knew. However, he did not consider himself as a good
                        father
                        figure. One day, in the subterranean city, Levi started a fight which he won easily. At that moment, Kenny
                        decided to leave him behind, satisfied that he had taught Levi the skills he needed to survive.
                    
                        Later, he became a notorious thug in the underground, but eventually left the place to join the Survey Corps.
                        Although he was at odds with Erwin, he ended up becoming one of his most trusted men.</p>

                        Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) is a former member of the Survey Corps and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan.
                        He lived in the Shiganshina District with his parents and adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman until the fall of Wall Maria.
                        During the incident, Eren impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan. This event would lead to Eren's
                        intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.
                        
                        Soon afterwards, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it
                        at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan serum.
                        
                        In the year 847, Eren, Mikasa, and his best friend, Armin Arlert joined the 104th Training Corps. The three graduated
                        with Eren ranking 5th best, and they joined the Survey Corps following the battle of Trost District.
                        
                        After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as
                        well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity
                        that lives across the ocean.
                        
                        Eren currently possesses the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titans.
                        After eating the younger sister of Willy during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <label>Appearance</label>
                    <p>
                        Eren is a young man of average height and muscular build. His facial features strongly resemble his mother's; he has a
                        reasonably long, rounded face and sizable, expressive, gray eyes. His hair is short and black, and his bangs fall in a
                        natural, middle-parted, curtain-type style. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very
                        physically fit and muscular, although this is often unseen due to his relatively baggy clothing.[39] After the four-year
                        time skip, Eren grew his hair down to his neck.
                        
                        Eren is first seen wearing typical townsfolk attire that consists of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels
                        at the collar, a reddish-brown coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a
                        black scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. As a teenager, he is often seen in the typical Survey Corps
                        uniform while training. His casual attire consists of a long beige shirt identical to the one he wore in his first
                        appearance, a maroon sash around his waist, white trousers, and brown knee-high boots. He always keeps the key given to
                        him by his father dangling around his neck on a string.
                        
                        By the time Eren infiltrates Marley in the year 854, Eren has grown visibly taller, and his hair has grown down to
                        shoulder length. He has a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that cover his forehead and left eye. To

                        right arm before it got corrected by Falco. After returning to Paradis Island, Eren discards his Survey Corps attire
                        and begins wearing a white shirt with dark pants underneath a simple black jacket.He ties his hair back into a bun
                        and shaves off his mustache and goatee.

                    <label>History</label>
                    <p>
                        Eren was born in Shiganshina District on March 30th, 835, in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Yeager and
                        Grisha Yeager. He had a few friends, although his best friend was Armin Arlert, whom he often defended from the
                        neighborhood bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the
                        outside world. He dreamed of joining the Survey Corps as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the
                        outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were frequently regarded as heretics and harassed constantly by
                        other children.
                        
                        When Eren was nine years old he accompanied his father on a house call to the Ackerman family's house only to find both
                        parents murdered and their daughter Mikasa missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Yeager instructed Eren to stay within the
                        house while he fetched the Military Police. Eren, however, tracked the robbers to a small cabin in the forest behind the
                        house.
                        
                        Eren kills a robber
                        Eren saved Mikasa from the robbers
                        
                        Thinking quickly, Eren feigned distress and claimed that he was lost. As one of the robbers approached Eren, he pulled
                        out a hidden knife and stabbed the man. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged him with a makeshift
                        spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa
                        looked on.
                        
                        As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by a third robber, who proceeded to strangle him. Eren
                        urged Mikasa, who was frozen in fear, to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As
                        Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through
                        the heart and killing him.
                        
                        Eren gives Mikasa his scarf
                        Eren gave Mikasa his scarf
                        
                        When Dr. Yeager eventually returned with the MPs, he took Eren aside, scolding him angrily for his reckless behavior.
                        While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the robbers.
                        When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Yeager invited Mikasa to
                        live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting
                        that they return home.
